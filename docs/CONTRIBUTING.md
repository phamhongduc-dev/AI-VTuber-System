### Commit Message Rules

1. **Capitalization**: Use lowercase for the type and description
2. **Punctuation**: No period at the end of the description
3. **Length**: Keep the subject line under 50 characters
4. **Mood**: Use imperative mood ("add", "fix", "update", not "added", "fixed", "updated")
5. **Scope**: Optional scope in parentheses (e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT validation`)

### Good vs Bad Examples

#### ‚úÖ Good Commit Messages

```
feat: add user registration endpoint
fix(auth): resolve JWT token validation issue
docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
refactor: extract database connection logic
test: add integration tests for user service
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

#### ‚ùå Bad Commit Messages

```
fixed bug
updated stuff
oops
I think I fixed it this time?
empty commit messages
```

### Writing Better Commit Messages

Think like a journalist! Ask yourself:

1. **What** did I change?
2. **Why** was this change needed?
3. **How** does this change work?

#### Example Transformation

Instead of:

```
git commit -m 'Add margin'
```

Use:

```
git commit -m 'style: add margin to nav items to prevent logo overlap'
```

### Commit Body

For complex changes, use the commit body to provide additional context:

```
feat: add user authentication system

- Implement JWT token generation and validation
- Add login and registration endpoints
- Include password hashing with bcrypt
- Add user role-based access control

Closes #123
```

### Breaking Changes

Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body to indicate breaking changes:

```
feat: change user API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: User API now returns user object instead of user ID
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Make your changes**: Follow the coding standards
3. **Write tests**: Ensure your code is properly tested
4. **Commit your changes**: Use conventional commit format
5. **Push your branch**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
